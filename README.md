Create a web-app in which the user can add todos. The app should have 4 pages:

a page for adding todos
a page for viewing todos
a page for deleting todos by their id
a page for viewing a single todo (read the todo id from the url or from an input on the page)
The todo object should contain:

id (generate randomly, or incrementally, or in any unique other way you preffer)
title
description
completed (boolean, true for completed, false for not completed, when creating a todo for the first time, set it to false)
You may use bootstrap to style the elements. You may use any design pattern you like.

The todos will come from the API presented at the course, similar to this one: https://github.com/xrusu/todo-api-nest. You do NOT have to write it / submit it.
